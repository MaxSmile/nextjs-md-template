Libi and Daughters is a luxury cosmetics company that offers a range of premium skincare products to customers worldwide. As their full stack development partner, we were responsible for developing both their front-end and back-end systems, using ReactJS and NodeJS respectively. Additionally, we designed and developed their native mobile applications for both iOS and Android, ensuring a seamless user experience across all platforms. Our team worked closely with Libi and Daughters to ensure that their online presence reflects their brand values of sophistication, quality, and elegance. Thanks to our collaboration, customers can now easily browse and purchase their favorite skincare products from anywhere, on any device.
