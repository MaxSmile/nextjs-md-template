KOKOMIX is a family-owned business that has been delivering top-quality ready-mix concrete in the Athienou area since its inception in 1996. Despite facing numerous challenges in the early days, the company's unwavering commitment to service and quality allowed it to thrive and expand.

Over the years, KOKOMIX has invested heavily in upgrading its production units, concrete trucks, and pumps to ensure that it can continue to meet the ever-increasing standards of its customers. Today, the company boasts a fleet of 18 top-of-the-line concrete trucks and six high-performance concrete pumps, ranging from 28m to 48m in length.

To further enhance its ability to serve customers, KOKOMIX made the strategic decision in 2007 to build a new factory in the industrial area of Tseri. This state-of-the-art facility opened in 2008 and has enabled the company to expand its reach and better serve customers in the Nicosia area.

To streamline communication between office workers and concrete drivers, KOKOMIX partnered with Vasilkoff to develop a custom platform. This cutting-edge solution has revolutionized the way the company operates, making it easier and faster to communicate vital information and ensuring that KOKOMIX continues to deliver the best possible service to its valued customers.

Overall, KOKOMIX's unwavering commitment to quality, innovation, and customer service has made it a leading player in the ready-mix concrete industry, and its dedication to excellence shows no signs of slowing down.
