When BandC IND. approached us to create a custom iOS app that would simplify their pricing process for custom-sized boxes, we were eager to take on the challenge. Our team worked closely with the company to understand their requirements and developed an app that would provide salespeople with up-to-date pricing quickly and easily.

The app was built using Objective-C and designed to be simple and user-friendly. Salespeople can now fill out the required information for each custom-sized box and get an instant price quote. The app can generate pricing for almost any size box that a customer may need, making it a powerful tool for sales teams.

One of the key features of the app is the ability to provide up-to-date pricing for custom-sized boxes. Salespeople can be confident that they are getting accurate pricing information, which helps them to close deals more effectively. This feature also ensures that BandC IND. remains competitive in a crowded marketplace.

The app has been designed to be flexible and adaptable to different customer needs. It can handle a wide variety of box sizes and shapes, and can even accommodate custom printing requirements. This makes it a valuable tool for sales teams who need to respond quickly to changing customer needs.

The app is currently available for delivery in Brooklyn, New Jersey, and Manhattan. Our team worked closely with BandC IND. to ensure that the app was fully integrated with their existing systems and processes. We also provided training and support to ensure that sales teams were able to use the app effectively.

Overall, the custom iOS app that we developed for BandC IND. has been a great success. Salespeople are now able to get up-to-date pricing for custom-sized boxes quickly and easily, which has helped them to close deals more effectively. The app has also enabled BandC IND. to stay competitive in a crowded marketplace by providing a streamlined pricing process.`,
